The main.py is where everything occurs.

If you would like to use a certain image you would run the code like,
	 python main.py "image name"

As well as if you would like to use multiscale you would need to include a boolean after the "image name", for example
	python main.py "image name.tif" True

The same is done if you would not want multiscale,
	python main.py "image name.jpg" False
